I have to thank the 3delight team very much. They allowed me to 
use their renderman souce code. So I adapted it in a lot of shaders.
This enabled me to create much more usable shaders in a shorter timeframe.

All shaders that have developed mostly by 3delight have a copyright info in the
header.

Of course because the procedure is so similiar, some shaders seem to be used from 3delight,
but they are complete self written, e.g. the mix colors (a trivial example I know).
