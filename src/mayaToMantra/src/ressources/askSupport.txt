Shader:
- how can I compile multiple shaders at once
- pack into library without .vex file?

ifd:
- add geo attribute like Cd for color override of instances

- seems I have to start rendering from shader directory because the vex files are not found otherwise...

general:
- do I really have to compile my standalone for every houdini update?
