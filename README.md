OpenMaya
========

This is a repository for all mayaTo renderer connections I create. 
There are connections for mantra (mayaToMantra) Appleseed (mayaToAppleseed) and others.

The idea is to develop a renderer framework to be able to implement a new renderer without reimplementing the 
same procedures again and again. 

A description of all renderers is/will be available on http://www.openmaya.net.
